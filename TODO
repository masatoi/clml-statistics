plans:
======
moments, cumulants for distributions
all C-Fs should use the C-F-guess-* functions
unify when to use double-floats and when integers/rationals
more variate relationships (like gamma - erlang - exponential)
confidence interval estimation
multivariate distributions
distribution options: lower tail / upper tail; logarithm

- Support Vector Machine
- NaiveBayes
- Neural Network
(kmeans, kNN, association analysis, principal component analysis etc.
 are not needed)

tools:
======
matrices (transpose, invert)
singular decomposition
determinants
qr
least squares
